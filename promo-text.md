Podman test project - can you help test cloud native containers on FreeBSD?

From September 2 to October 11, 2024, the FreeBSD OCI Runtime Extension Working Group is hosting a time-boxed testing project for its experimental implementation of Podman. If you're comfortable with experimental software and have experience with Docker or Podman, we want you on board. All you need is a machine running FreeBSD 13.2 or later with ZFS storage. This is your chance to explore a fully featured, daemonless container engine that provides a Docker-CLI compatible experience on FreeBSD. 

Help us understand user needs by deploying your workloads, identifying bugs, and suggesting improvements. Your feedback will be invaluable as we bring container support to FreeBSD through the OCI Runtime Extension.

For more information, please visit our [FreeBSD Podman Testing repo](https://github.com/oci-playground/freebsd-podman-testing/blob/main/README.md) in the OCI Playground.
